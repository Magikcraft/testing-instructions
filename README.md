### Onboarding sessions

We hold live onboarding sessions via video conferencing. If, after following the instructions on this page, you require assistance in getting started, or have some questions you would like answered in person, or you would like to meet the team behind MC:T1, you are welcome to join one of the sessions. For more details see the [Onboarding Session Schedule](#onboarding-session-schedule).

### Prerequisites

* You need a PC or a Mac for this - either a desktop or a laptop. This only runs on a PC or Mac. Not on tablets, or iPhones, or consoles.
* You can get a license for Minecraft Java Edition for PC/Mac from [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net). It is AUD$35. If you have trouble using your credit card from Australia, buy a Minecraft gift card from 7/11 or Coles. 

### Playing MC:T1

2. Start the Magikcraft client.
3. Log in with your Minecraft account.
4. Click on "Join Magikcraft"
5. You will appear in the Magikcraft lobby. Look around, and head through the "MCT1" portal.
6. You will appear in the MCT1 world, and a 60-second countdown timer will start.
7. After sixty seconds you will be struck down with T1.
8. Ten seconds later, you will warp to the training facility.
9. Complete each stage of the training to move to the next stage.
